# Patient visualization

MIMIC-III is a large relational database, with many diverse data types. This method of data storage does not provide an intuitive picture of a patient stay, nor does it facilitate quick retrieval of information particular to a single patient. 

Gaining a comprehensive understanding of what data are available, when they are available, and possible caveats is a time-consuming process when querying across multiple tables of the database. 

The patient visualization tool is a graphical interface for exploring data at a patient level.  It is intended for light exploration of the data, in particular for researchers who are new to MIMIC-III.

## Notes and limitations

While we will aim to provide a stable service, our laboratory has limited resources and so we cannot commit to providing continuous uptime.

## Access the application

The patient visualization tool is currently in private testing. It will be made available to the wider MIMIC community once this testing phase is complete.
