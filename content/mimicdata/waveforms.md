# Waveforms vs. clinical data

This website provides documentation for the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. A separate, complementary resource named the "MIMIC-III Waveform Database" contains high resolution waveforms and numerics (second by second derived values from the waveforms). For information on the linked waveform data, see: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic3wdb/
